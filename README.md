## Replicating the google homepage

Replicating the google homepage was the first assignment in The Odin Project. The goal was to replicate it without using any tutorials, only using the knowledge acquired in the course, and whatever is available on google. 

Throughout the project, I encountered difficulties, such as: 
* Horizontally aligning items
* Finding the correct CSS property for a particular element
* Getting everything aligned properly

All in all, I'm happy with the result, and I look forward getting back to this project in a month to apply all the new knowledge I've managed to acquire. 

### Adding search functionality

I managed to 'hijack' google's search functionality and connect it to the search button. I have not connected the 'I'm Feeling lucky' button to any functionality, and the links are also 'dummy' links except the user icon in the top right that is linked to my GitHub page.
