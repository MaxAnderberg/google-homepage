# Replicating Google homepage

This [assignment's](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css) goal is to replicate the Google homepage without using any online tutorials. I am only allowed to use the knowledge acquired in the course, and to google specific issues that I encounter.


## Funcitonality

Most of the links are dummy links except for the profile icon in the top right which takes the user to my GitHub page. Furthermore, I connected Google's search functionality to the search button - so searching on google is viable. 

## Learning outcomes

Below are a couple of key areas that I found to be challenging: 

* Horizontally aligning items and containers
* Building the search box container
* Aligning items properly
